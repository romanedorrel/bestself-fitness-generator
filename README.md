# BestSelf — Fitness & Meal Generation System

## Live Demo
https://bestself-fitness-generator.vercel.app

BestSelf is a full-stack Next.js application built using the App Router architecture. It dynamically generates structured workout routines and meal recommendations based on user-selected parameters.

The system applies rule-based filtering and randomized selection logic through modular components and API routes to produce tailored fitness and nutrition outputs within defined constraints.

## 🚀 Core Features

### 🏋️ Workout Generation
- Filter by body focus
- Select intensity level
- Choose workout frequency
- Dynamic routine generation based on user-defined parameters

### 🍽 Meal Generation
- Category filtering (seafood, chicken, beef, breakfast, lunch, dinner)
- Structured meal data modeling
- Randomized selection within defined constraints

---

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

BestSelf is built using the Next.js App Router and leverages API route handlers located in `app/api/` to manage generation logic.

### Application Structure
- `app/` — App Router structure
- `app/api/` — Server-side route handlers
- Modular UI components
- Separation of business logic and presentation
- Parameter validation and controlled randomization

The architecture emphasizes modularity, scalability, and maintainability.
